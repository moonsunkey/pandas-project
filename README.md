# pandas-project
The Starter codes made this project 50% easier. 

There are quite a few different ways to get to the required results. Looking back, I didn't take enough time to look at the two individual dataframes before diving into the merged dataframe. Sometimes extracting information from one of the originals is easier than from the merged.
Also over complicated the school_summary part which costed me at least 3 hours.

The assignemt flow shows how to step by step arrive at conclusions about student performance based on per student budget, school size and school type. 

The most challenges:

Binning, didn't follow the code and accidentally overwrote the Total Students Column instead of creating School Size column. Didn't fully understand/notice that even after going through the last binning in the assignment that a new column was created.
In school_summary, initially I didn't use groupby to get the various counts. The display didn't show school name index, instead only the numeric index. This caused issue later on when math functions were performed.
